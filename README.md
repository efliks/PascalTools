# Pascal Tools

A small collection of mathematical tools written in Borland Pascal in 2004. 

Two makefiles are attached to make possible compilation under modern Linux with 
[Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org), and under MS-DOS with 
[Borland Pascal 7](https://winworldpc.com/product/borland-pascal/7x).

The tools including their source code are all in Polish, sorry!!!

## fxx

Numerical algorithms for polynomials:
* integration
* finding solutions
* finding local extrema
* calculating derivatives, etc.

Polynomials are user-defined.

## matrices

A fairly extensive program that works on 4x4 matrices. It computes:
* determinant
* transposed matrix
* inverse matrix
* product of matrices
* sum and difference of matrices
* multiplies matrix by number
* diagonalizes vector
* reads and writes matrices to files

## progs7

7 short programs written during computer science classes. Among them:
* calculator
* calculating perfect numbers
* calculating prime numbers
* lottery
* converting numbers to binary and ternary systems
* and others
